## üìö About

Welcome to UNB Hub, a mobile application developed for the Information Systems course at the University of Bras√≠lia\! Our goal is to simplify the academic lives of students by offering a set of essential tools for organization and planning. This project stands out for its use of AI to optimize the requirements engineering and prototyping process for new features.

UNB Hub was born from the need to centralize various useful functions for university life. Conceived in React Native, this project went through an extensive design process in Figma, where all screens, business rules, and requirements were meticulously defined. The current phase culminated in the implementation of the Class Schedule feature, showcasing the practical application of Generative AI to aid in software development.

Currently, we have focused on implementing the **Class Schedule** functionality, which allows you to visualize your class times and subjects intuitively. We have ambitions to integrate other tools like a calendar and a to-do list in the future.

## üìå Features

  * **Intelligent Class Schedule:** Visualize your subjects and weekly class times.
  * **Add Subjects:** Add new classes with time and weekday selectors.
  * **Customization:** Choose personalized colors for your subjects.
  * **Data Storage:** Data is saved locally using SQLite.
  * **Design:** Modern and responsive interface with Tailwind CSS.
  * **Academic Calendar (WIP):** Stay updated with important events and deadlines.
  * **Personal To-do List (WIP):** Organize your tasks and commitments.
  * **Flowchart Generator (WIP):** Create and visualize course flowcharts.

## üë®‚Äçüíª How to Run

**Prerequisites:**

  * Node.js (v18+).
  * Expo CLI (`npm install -g expo-cli`).
  * Mobile device with [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) or an Android/iOS emulator.

<!-- end list -->

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dancpluz/unb-hub/
    ```
    ```bash
    cd unb-hub
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Start the application:**
    ```bash
    expo start
    ```
4.  **Scan the QR code** with Expo Go (Android/iOS) or press `a` for Android, `i` for iOS, or `w` for web.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues

  * **Build error (NativeWind):**

    ```bash
    npx expo start -c
    ```

  * **Database:**
    The database is created automatically on the first run of the application.
